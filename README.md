Arduino Etch-a-Sketch using HTML5 Canvas and Breakout.js
========================================================

Quick hack from the LondonJS Night Class "Introduction to Arduino with JavaScript" session hosted by Lily Madar
on 19th March 2014.

See `Breakout/examples/peter` folder.

NB. We also tried various simpler tasks - see the backup.js file there for some of the code. Needs tidying up.

Based on Breakout.js - see `Breakout/LICENSE` for license details.
